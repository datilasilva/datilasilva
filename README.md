## About

I am an energetic, creative and proactive person, that loves a good challenge. I am eager to learn and improve myself with new skills.
 
As a former lawyer analysing documents and files was a part of my daily routine and in my quest to explore new career options, I naturally identified myself with the data analysis field. For me, it is a clear translation from my previous experience. 

I am always looking forward to going through the collected data and finding the best solution to solve whatever challenge is presented to me. The solution should result in the best way to conciliate the business values versus the customer interest.

During my study time in the Data Analytics course at Hyper Island, I got to learn how to work with the primordial tools used in the field, such as different spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel and Google spreadsheets), Google Analytics, Hotjar, SQL, Python and Power BI. Not only these, but I have also used the following tools to support my work: Colaboratory (Google Collab), Miro, Trello, Canvas, Adobe XD and Figma. I have some basic knowledge of Visual Studio Code, Git and Github.

I am looking for a position as Data Analyst based on my knowledge described above. 

I see myself as a team player and would love to join a company that is looking for a person with problem-solving skills and attention to detail while being easygoing and able to learn on a daily basis.

#####  Project at Hyper Island led me to face the "fear" of my "browsing history". Google makes available on this site takeout.google.com the option to download various data about location and history. After cleaning the data, it is possible to have fun and analyze its virtual behavior over the years. I discovered that I really like creating playlists on YouTube and I have 1 playlist for every moment (243 subscriptions/channel)! After separating by time, years and analyzing my sample, it was possible to create some graphs and find the times when I look for more songs/videos, for example, motivation (around 7pm), love (11pm), and music religious - and the years I've done more.
